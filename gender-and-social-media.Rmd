# Gender and Facebook use
There is a stereotype that women are more sociable than men. Therefore we expect women to be more likely than men to have Facebook accounts.

H1 Gender is associated with Facebook use
(H0 Gender is not associated with Facebook use)

```{r setup}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

options(scipen = 999)

bes_2017 <- read_csv('../data/BES-2017-f2f-gender-fb-tw.csv')
```

```{r visualisation}
bes_2017 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Gender, fill = Use_Facebook)) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge')
```

```{r significance-test}
chisq.test(
  x = bes_2017$Gender,
  y = bes_2017$Use_Facebook
)
```
